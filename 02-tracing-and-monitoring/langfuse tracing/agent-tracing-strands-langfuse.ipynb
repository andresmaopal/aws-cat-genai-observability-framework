    "## Overview\n",
    "The focus of this notebook is to build a **multi agent application** using diverse agents framework — Strands, LangGraph and Amazon Bedrock..\n",
    "\n",
    "Strands Agents have build-in support for **observability with LangFuse**. On this example we will demonstrate how to build an agent with observability and evaluation. We will leverage [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) to process the Strands Agent traces and [Ragas](https://www.ragas.io/) metrics to evaluate the performance of  agent. The primary focus is on agent evaluation the quality of responses generated by the Agent use the traces produced by the SDK. \n",
