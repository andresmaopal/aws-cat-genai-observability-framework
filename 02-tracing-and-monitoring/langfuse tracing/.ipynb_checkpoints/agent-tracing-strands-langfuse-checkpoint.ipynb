    "## Overview\n",
    "The focus of this notebook is to build a **multi agent application** using diverse agents framework — Strands, LangGraph and Amazon Bedrock..\n",
    "\n",
    "Strands Agents have build-in support for **observability with LangFuse**. On this example we will demonstrate how to build an agent with observability and evaluation. We will leverage [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) to process the Strands Agent traces and [Ragas](https://www.ragas.io/) metrics to evaluate the performance of  agent. The primary focus is on agent evaluation the quality of responses generated by the Agent use the traces produced by the SDK. \n",

Sushi House is one of the best sushi restaurants in Laureles.\\\\n\\\\nMedellin is a culinary powerhouse, and you’ll find some of the best food in Colombia here. From street food to five-star restaurants, there’s something for everyone in Medellin. And, don’t forget to try the city’s famous coffee!\\\\n\\\\nOne food that you don’t want to miss is the sushi. [...] My second stop was Sushi Market. Sushi Market has 9 locations in Medellin, so you shouldn’t have any trouble finding one near you.\\\\n\\\\nThe one in the Laureles neighborhood is actually next door to one of the best burger joints in the Medellin, Chef Burger. So, the restaurant is surrounded by vegetation giving it privacy from the busy street. [...] While this was the case at most of the restaurants I looked at, several rolls didn’t have any cream cheese. So, if you’re a sushi purist and don’t like the idea of cream cheese in your rolls, then you’ll still be able to find some options in Laureles.\\\\n\\\\nIn Medellin, Laureles is an up-and-coming neighborhood that has several good sushi restaurants.
